# Hostel-Management-NIT-Rourkela
This is a real world project based on Reactjs, Nodejs, mongoDB, etc.<br>
## Problem Solved -<br>
In my college, students are allotted hostels randomly but most of them want to stay with their friends(want to share room). Here this project plays a crucial role, It is a live website where students can create an online query that contains Roll No, Name, current Room No, current hostel, preferred hostel, and mobile number.<br> Also students can see other listed records on the website.
Before accessing all these features, student has to register himself with his Roll No.
So, in this way students can connnect and mutually exchange rooms/hostels.
